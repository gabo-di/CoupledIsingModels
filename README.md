This is repository to make simulations with Coupled Ising Models
The idea is to implement various updating algorihtms that run in CPU and GPU
and have mean field approximations too


## TODO
[ ] CPU chess update
[ ] GPU chess update
[ ] GPU Little update
[ ] Define the appropriate Hamiltonian for Little update
[ ] Temporal mean value of various observables
[ ] Coupled Ising Models simultaneous
[ ] Coupled Ising Models step by step
[ ] Plots of Ising Models in time
[ ] Optimization of algorithms 
[ ] Other Methods of Mean values, like Plefka approximations
