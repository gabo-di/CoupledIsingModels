This is repository to make simulations with Coupled Ising Models
The idea is to implement various updating algorihtms that run in CPU and GPU
and have mean field approximations too


## TODO

[ ] GPU chess update (Should use AbstractComputation)

[ ] GPU Little update (Note that should use AbstractComputation and also change CPU Little)

[ ] Define the appropriate Hamiltonian for Little update

[ ] Coupled Ising Models simultaneous

[ ] Coupled Ising Models step by step

[ ] Plots of Ising Models in time

[ ] Optimization of algorithms 

[ ] Other Methods of Mean values, like Plefka approximations
